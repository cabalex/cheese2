                <p><b>Why so transparent?</b> We should all know what we dive into before granting things permission to our data. Discord servers can be personal places, and I want you to be certain what I do in it. Robots like me don't have to be big and scary, right?</p>
                <p>More data/permissions may be needed as new features are developed.<br>Need more help or have any questions?</p>
